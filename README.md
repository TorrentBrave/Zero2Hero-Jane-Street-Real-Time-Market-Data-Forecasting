# [JS | Understanding The Metric: Weighted R-squared](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlolepelaars/understanding-the-metric-weighted-r-squared)

In this kernel we take a deep dive into weighted __$R^2$__ for the [___2024 Jane Street competition___](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting).

Due to the interesting structure of the competition weights in the training data we will also learn more about the [__Gamma Distribution__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution).
