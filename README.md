# [JS | Understanding The Metric: Weighted R-squared](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlolepelaars/understanding-the-metric-weighted-r-squared)

In this kernel we take a deep dive into weighted __$R^2$__ for the [___2024 Jane Street competition___](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting).

Due to the interesting structure of the competition weights in the training data we will also learn more about the [__Gamma Distribution__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution).

* [__Quadratic Weighted Kappa__](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlolepelaars/understanding-the-metric-quadratic-weighted-kappa)

# [JS | Day 0 EDA and feature importance](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahsuna123/jane-street-24-day-0-eda-and-feature-importance)

* The train.csv file is big
* responders
* weight
* Cumulative return
* Time
* The features.csv file
* The first day ("day 0")
* Are there any missing values?
* Is there any missing data: Days 2 and 294
* Permutation Importance using the Random Forest
* Is there any correlation between day 100 and day 200?
